# What is this even?
This is the development repository for the RaidersDropLoot mod for farthest frontier.

# How do I install the mod?
First of all, you will need to install [Melon Loader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/),
a universal mod loader for unity games.
Follow their [installation instructions](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=automated-installation)
and run the game at least once to make sure everything is set up correctly. 

Then copy the RaidersDropLoot.dll into the "Mods" folder of the farthest frontier directory.
